Welcome to the 2023 edition of Kaggle's Playground Series!
Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to last year's Tabular Playground Series. And many thanks to all those who took the time to provide constructive feedback! We're thrilled that there continues to be interest in these types of challenges, and we're continuing the series this year but with a few changes.

First, the series is getting upgraded branding. We've dropped "Tabular" from the name because, while we anticipate this series will still have plenty of tabular competitions, we'll also be having some other formats as well. You'll also notice freshly-upgraded (better looking and more fun!) banner and thumbnail images.

Second, rather than naming the challenges by month and year, we're moving to a Season-Edition format. This year is Season 3, and each challenge will be a new Edition. We're doing this to have more flexibility. Competitions going forward won't necessarily align with each month like they did in previous years (although some might!), we'll have competitions with different time durations, and we may have multiple competitions running at the same time on occasion.

Regardless of these changes, the goals of the Playground Series remain the sameâ€”to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. We hope we continue to meet this objective!

With the great start and participation in January, we will continue launching the Tabular Tuesday in February every Tuesday 00:00 UTC, with each competition running for 2 weeks instead. Again, these will be fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.
